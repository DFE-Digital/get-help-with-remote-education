      From 5 January 2021, all schools are required to close to most pupils and students. Whilst vulnerable pupils and students, and the children of key workers, can continue to be educated in
      person, DfE expects schools to immediately offer all other pupils and students access to remote education. Updates to remote education expectations are set out within the guidance for full
      opening, which can be found within the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak" class="govuk-link">actions for schools during
      the coronavirus outbreak</a>
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The Secretary of State for Education has given a temporary continuity direction which requires schools to provide remote education for state-funded, school-age children unable
      to attend school due to coronavirus (COVID-19). Read the
      <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/remote-education-temporary-continuity-direction-explanatory-note">remote education temporary continuity direction explanatory note</a>
      for more information. The direction poses no additional expectations on the quality of remote education expected of schools beyond those set out in the guidance for full opening within the actions for schools.

      Schools should keep a record of, and monitor pupils’ and students’ engagement with remote education, but this does not need to be tracked in the attendance register.

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Where restrictions are put in place to contain local outbreaks or pupils and students are required to self-isolate, remote provision can be extended to meet pupils' and students'
      needs. FE colleges should have contingency plans in place to move quickly to blended or, if necessary, remote education should the need arise.
