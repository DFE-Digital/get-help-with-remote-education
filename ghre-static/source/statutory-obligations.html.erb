      From 5 January 2021, all schools and colleges are required to close to most pupils and students. Whilst vulnerable pupils and students, and the children of key workers, can
      continue to be educated in person, DfE expects schools and colleges to immediately offer all other pupils and students access to remote education. Read the updated remote
      education expectations for <a href="#schools" class="govuk-link">schools</a> and for <a href="#further-education" class="govuk-link">further education</a>.
