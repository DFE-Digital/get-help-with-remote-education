            Attendance is mandatory for all pupils of compulsory school age. Schools subject to the
            <%= link_to_govuk_content("remote education temporary continuity direction", "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/remote-education-temporary-continuity-direction-explanatory-note") %>
            are required to provide remote education to pupils covered by the direction where their attendance would be
            contrary to government guidance or legislation around COVID-19. This includes, for example, where such
            guidance means that a class, group or a small number of pupils need to self-isolate. All such pupils not
            physically unwell should have access to remote education as soon as reasonably practicable, which may be the
            next school day.
          </p>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            Independent Schools (not including academies) are only covered by the remote education temporary continuity
            direction in relation to state-funded pupils in their schools. However, they are still expected to meet the
            <%= link_to_govuk_content("Independent School Standards", "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulating-independent-schools") %>
            in full at all times.
          </p>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            From September 2021, we continue to expect schools to provide remote education for pupils whose attendance
            would be contrary to government guidance or legislation around Covid-19. Schools should therefore maintain
            their capabilities to deliver high quality remote education for next academic year.
          </p>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            Where needed, the remote education provided should be equivalent in length to the core teaching pupils would
            receive in school and should include recorded or live direct teaching time, as well as time for pupils to
            complete tasks and assignments independently. As a minimum you should provide:
          </p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Key Stage 1: 3 hours a day on average across the cohort, with less for younger children</li>
            <li>Key Stage 2: 4 hours a day</li>
            <li>Key Stages 3 and 4: 5 hours a day</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            Online video lessons do not necessarily need to be recorded by teaching staff at the school. High quality
            lessons developed by external providers can be provided in lieu of school led video content.
          </p>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            In developing remote education, we expect you to:
          </p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>teach a planned and well-sequenced curriculum so that knowledge and skills are built incrementally</li>
            <li>have a good level of clarity about what is intended to be taught and practised in each subject so that
              pupils can progress through the school’s curriculum
            </li>
            <li>
              select a digital platform for remote education provision that will be used consistently across the school
              in order to allow interaction, assessment and feedback and make sure staff are trained and confident in
              its use. If schools do not have an education platform in place, they can access free support at
              <%= link_to_govuk_content("get help with technology", "https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/") %>
            </li>
            <li>
              overcome barriers to digital access for pupils by, for example:
              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>distributing school-owned laptops accompanied by a user agreement or contract</li>
                <li>securing appropriate internet connectivity solutions</li>
                <li>providing printed resources, such as textbooks and workbooks, to structure learning, supplemented
                  with other forms of communication to keep pupils on track or answer questions about work
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>have systems for checking, daily, whether pupils are engaging with their work, and work with families to
              rapidly identify effective solutions where engagement is a concern
            </li>
            <li>identify a named senior leader with overarching responsibility for the quality and delivery of remote
              education, including that provision meets expectations for remote education
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            When teaching pupils remotely we expect schools to:
          </p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>set meaningful and ambitious work each day in an appropriate range of subjects</li>
            <li>
              consider how to transfer into remote education what we already know about effective teaching in the live
              classroom by, for example:
              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>providing frequent, clear explanations of new content, delivered by a teacher or through
                  high-quality curriculum resources
                </li>
                <li>providing opportunities for interactivity, including questioning, eliciting and reflective
                  discussion
                </li>
                <li>providing scaffolded practice and opportunities to apply new knowledge</li>
                <li>enabling pupils to receive timely and frequent feedback on how to progress, using
                  digitally-facilitated or whole-class feedback where appropriate
                </li>
                <li>using assessment to ensure teaching is responsive to pupils’ needs and addresses any critical gaps
                  in pupils’ knowledge
                </li>
                <li>avoiding an over-reliance on long-term projects or internet research activities</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            We expect you to consider these expectations in relation to the pupils’ age, stage of development or special
            educational needs, for example where this would place significant demands on parents’ help or support.
          </p>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            We continue to expect schools to publish information about their remote education provision on their
            websites and this should be kept up to date. An optional template is available to support schools in doing
            this.
          </p>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            Younger children in Key Stage 1 or Reception often require high levels of parental involvement to support
            their engagement with remote education, which makes digital provision a particular challenge for this age
            group. We, therefore, do not expect that solely digital means will be used to teach these pupils remotely.
          </p>
          <p class="govuk-body">If pupils with special educational needs or disabilities (SEND) are not able to be in
            school their teachers are best placed to know how the pupil’s needs can be most effectively met to ensure
            they continue to make progress.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">We recognise that some pupils with SEND may not be able to access remote education
            without adult support and so expect schools to work with families to deliver an ambitious curriculum
            appropriate for their level of need.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            The requirement for schools within the

            to use their best endeavours to secure the special educational provision called for by the pupils’ special
            educational needs remains in place.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">You should work collaboratively with families and put in place reasonable adjustments so
            that pupils with SEND can successfully access remote education. In this situation, decisions on how
            provision can be delivered should be informed by relevant considerations including the types of services
            that the pupil can access remotely.</p>
