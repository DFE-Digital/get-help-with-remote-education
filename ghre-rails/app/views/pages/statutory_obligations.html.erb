  The Coronavirus Act 2020 and provision of remote education (England) temporary continuity (no. 2) direction expired on 24 March 2022 meaning that schools no longer have a legal duty to provide remote education.

  <p class="govuk-body">
  Where possible schools should provide remote education to allow pupils to keep pace with their education when in-person attendance is either not possible or contrary to government guidance. Schools should therefore continue to be prepared to implement high-quality remote education so that any pupil who is well enough to learn from home, but unable to attend school in person, can continue to do so.

  We have published <%= link_to_govuk_content("guidance on remote education for schools", "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/providing-remote-education-guidance-for-schools") %>. We will continue to work with the sector on this, learning from the many examples of excellent practice developed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
