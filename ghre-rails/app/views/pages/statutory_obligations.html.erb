      Where a pupil, class, group or small number of pupils need to self-isolate, or there are local restrictions in place requiring pupils to remain at home,
      DfE expects schools to be able to immediately offer them access to remote education.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The Secretary of State for Education has given a temporary continuity direction which requires schools to provide remote education for state-funded, school-age children unable
      to attend school due to coronavirus (COVID-19). Read the
      <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/remote-education-temporary-continuity-direction-explanatory-note">remote education temporary continuity direction explanatory note</a>

      Where restrictions are put in place to contain local outbreaks or pupils and students are required to self-isolate, remote provision can be extended to meet pupils' and students'
      needs. FE colleges should have contingency plans in place to move quickly to blended or, if necessary, remote education should the need arise.
