      However, many of these pupils and students have remained in remote education. These pupils and students will continue with remote education if a pupil, class, group or a small number of pupils need to self-isolate. They may also remain at home where there are local or national restrictions in place.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Where vulnerable pupils are self-isolating, it is important that systems are in place to keep in contact with them.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      When a vulnerable pupil is required to self-isolate, you should:
    </p>
    <ul
      class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"
    >
      <li>notify their social worker (if they have one)</li>
      <li>agree with the social worker the best way to maintain contact and offer support</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      You should have procedures in place to: 
    </p>
    <ul
      class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"
    >
      <li>check if a vulnerable pupil is able to access remote education support </li>
      <li>support them to access remote education (as far as possible) </li>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Get devices for those who cannot attend school</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      If a child or young person without access to a device is advised not to attend school by a GP or specialist clinician, their school should contact the Department for Education (DfE) for support. You can read further guidance on

      DfE revised Keeping Children Safe in Education, which came into force on 1 September 2020, and it now includes additional information and 
      support to help schools and colleges keep children and young people safe online. It includes for the first time a dedicated collection of 
      resources (at Annex C) to support safe remote education, virtual lessons and live streaming. It also includes support for schools and colleges 
      to signpost parents and carers to help them keep their children safe online.
